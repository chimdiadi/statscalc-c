The following tasks need to be done to get a fully working project:

* Set up a remote repository. You can e.g. create a project in GitHub or GitLab and run
  the following commands in your locally generated project folder: `git remote add origin <Remote-URL>`
  For a seamless integration, the name of the project should also be `statscalc-c`.
* Make sure that the following software is installed on your computer:
  * A C++-20-compliant C++ compiler
  * CMake `>= 3.9`
  * The testing framework [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)

  that you need to login at [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) and click the button
  *Import a Project*.
* Make sure that doxygen is installed on your system, e.g. by doing `sudo apt install doxygen`
  on Debian or Ubuntu.
